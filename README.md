# Bulltrout_current
This is in open project where I am working on the results of a Python based reintroduction simulation of Bull Trout to a previously extirpated watershed.  
We assess these data based on demographic and population genetic heuristics.  As a result, these scripts etc. are not clean/finished but it will give you an idea
of how to assess these data.  We have one publication out on this already, a lot code here is used to assess these data.
